    Migrated the OTAP environments of the main applied university website to secure Azure subscriptions and greatly reduced the cloud spend.\\
  }
  {
    \item Migrated and hardened cloud components to a Hub spoke architecture with management group policies enabled and modifications only allowed via pipeline deployments
    \item Automated infrastructure and microservice deployments through GitLab CI/CD streets
    \item Reduced the monthly cloud expenditure by 55\%
    \item Ensured that databases can be recovered with a 12 hour recovery period
    \item Ensured that on-prem Linux servers Bloomreach servers are available and work appropriately while they still received traffic. Make changes in Ansible and/or Jenkins scripts where applicable and periodically review Linux server settings.

  {Azure Cloud Developer}
  {December 2023 -- May 2024)}
  {NS (Utrecht) via Freshminds (Leiden)}
  {
    Helped in constructing and maintaining a modular solution for data teams to seamlessly set up data science projects, setting appropriate permissions on projects, and enabling teams to use Terraform and Azure Devops efficiently.\\
  }
  {
    \item Implemented C\# TUI application to simplify code changes, auto-format and validate changes for data teams
    \item Constructed a simplified architecture today through which the Snowflake permissions of teams can be simplified and more easily governed
    \item Implemented pull request validations for IaC and authorizations using Python scripts
    \item Helped data teams solve their storage- and permission-related issues. Their questions are either conceptual or require support with respect to pull requests

{Taqa (Alkmaar) via Xebia | Xpirit (Hilversum)}
{ I worked in the DevOps team responsible for the full IT landscape, from C\# microservices and Vue frontend, to the configuration of a complex Kubernetes cluster and CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure and application deployments.}
{
\item Implemented structural improvements to the Invoice service and Allocation service which calculates how much gas should flow through the gas pipeline hour by hour. I ensured that allocated quantities in the past can never change and rigorously tested these features using Specflow. The total test suite contained over 1300 tests.
\item Ensured Infrastructure as Code (IaC) definitions were fully idempotent and could be safely redeployed from scratch
\item Re-engineered failover pipelines to ensure reliable and seamless failover operations
\item Deployed robust Kubernetes configurations and maintained up-to-date Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters
\item Mitigated security vulnerabilities identified by Microsoft Defender for Cloud
