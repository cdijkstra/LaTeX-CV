\section{\faCoffee\ Hobbies \& Interests}
I enjoy a wide range of hobbies, from reading (including fantasy, self-improvement, and De Correspondent) to cooking — especially Italian, Thai, and Indian cuisine.  I’m also a fan of immersive and strategic board games, with favorites like Terra Mystica, Orl\'{e}ans and Great Western Trail.

Each year in December I participate in the \href{https://adventofcode.com/}{Advent of Code} to advance my programming skills by solving interesting puzzles. In 2023
I completed all puzzles in \href{https://github.com/cdijkstra/AdventOfCode2023}{C\#} and in 2024 I had 92\% in \href{https://github.com/cdijkstra/AdventOfCode2024}{Python}

Beyond my interests in tabletop games and programming, I also enjoy staying active. I do sports several times a week, including bouldering, wakeboarding, and kitesurfing (depending on the season). I'm a passionate winter sports enthusiast as well, and try to hit the French or Austrian Alps at least once a year. I also love to travel and recently returned from an incredible five-month backpacking journey through South America.
